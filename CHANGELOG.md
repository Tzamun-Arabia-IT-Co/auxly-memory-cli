# Changelog

All notable changes to Auxly Memory CLI are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.7]

### Added — Memory Organization tab

- **Dedicated "Memory Org" dashboard tab (`5`)**: an on-demand AI pass that
  consolidates, deduplicates, and re-files the memory vault behind a
  **preview-and-confirm** review. Nothing is written until the user approves.
- **Full provider + model picker**: any installed CLI agent (Claude, Codex,
  Gemini, Cursor, Antigravity) runs headless on the user's existing
  subscription — no API key — or a local/API endpoint (Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini,
  or any OpenAI-compatible Custom URL with auto-fetched models).
- **Per-file before/after review**: two-pane, color-coded add/remove diff;
  approve / reject / edit each file (`a` / `r` / `e`), `A` approves all, and
  approving auto-advances to the next undecided file.
- **Cancel a running organize**: `esc` on the running screen tears down the
  agent subprocess or HTTP request via context cancellation.
- **Pre-run preview**: the idle and confirm screens estimate how many tokens
  and files will be sent before launching.
- **Post-write confirmation + history**: the done screen lists exactly which
  files were written with `+added / -removed` counts; every write is recorded
  in the Audit Trail.
- **Audit Trail `Type` column + filter**: each entry is classified
  (Memory Org / Write / Approval / Session); press `f` to cycle the filter.

### Added — Claude Code statusline (`auxly statusline`)

- A productized Go renderer for a rich **4-line Claude Code statusline**:
  where (folder · branch · model · version), session (thinking · effort ·
  tokens · context bar), Auxly memory (link · role · last op · pending), and
  live Claude plan usage (5h + weekly bars with reset countdowns + freshness).
- **Never makes a network call** — the usage line reads only the last-good
  snapshot the Live Usage subsystem persists to disk.
- `auxly statusline` (full) · `--segment` (Auxly lines only) · `--wrap` (run the
  user's own statusline, then append the Auxly segment).
- `auxly statusline install [--wrap]` / `uninstall` — **additive + reversible**:
  backs up the user's prior command and restores it verbatim; atomic settings.json
  write; never destructively overwrites a non-Auxly statusline.
- **Settings → Customizations sub-tab**: opt-in selector (Use Auxly / Wrap mine /
  None) with a **live preview from real data**, a confirm dialog, and a
  Claude-Code-only banner. Applies in-process via the same install code as the CLI.
- Applying an option shows an **in-progress "Applying…" state** that holds until the
  write completes and the confirmation lands (the apply runs as an async command, so
  the UI never blocks and input is frozen until it resolves).

### Added — Dashboard

- **Recent Memory Changes feed**: the dashboard now shows the latest writes
  (time · type · file · ±lines) so it answers "what just happened" at a glance.
- **Memory by category**: a per-category breakdown with proportional bars,
  turning the bare entry total into a picture of the vault's composition.
- **Last-write freshness line** in the header (`✎ Last write: 4m ago · …`).
- The recent feed names the **writing agent** and shows a **date** on
  older rows; category bars have a visible track and tag the personal tier 🔒.
- **Pending approvals inline**: when the queue is non-empty, the waiting items
  are listed on the dashboard with a pointer to the Approvals tab.
- **Remote access scope**: each connected box shows what it can reach
  (`🔑 read · 6 file(s)`), resolved from the same sharing ACL the host enforces.
- All of these render only when the terminal has room; short panes keep the
  existing compact layout (the responsive fit guarantee is preserved).

### Changed

- Organize is scoped to **user-memory files only** on both input and output —
  agent setup/instruction files (`agents.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `providers.md`, the generated aggregate) are never read or rewritten.
- Organize moved out of Settings into its own tab; Settings keeps trust
  levels, Live Usage, and the Agents sub-tab.
- Dashboard tab order is now Dashboard · Activity · Files · Approvals ·
  Memory Org · Analytics · Settings · Remote · Skills · Audit Trail (`0`).

### Fixed

- **Codex** now runs outside a git repo via `--skip-git-repo-check` (was
  exiting 1 in the isolated working directory).
- **Resilient JSON parsing** of agent output: a string-aware extractor returns
  the first balanced object (dropping surrounding prose/log noise), and a
  lenient repair pass salvages unescaped quotes/newlines that weaker models
  emit — the most common cause of "invalid character … after key:value pair".
- The agent-run timeout is detected on the run context (not the parent), and a
  user cancel is reported distinctly from a genuine failure.
- The Direct-LLM path honors the cancel/timeout context for its HTTP request.
- Fixed a doubled `Authorization: Bearer` header on the Direct-LLM path.

### Security

- Organize agents run with **no tools**, an **empty working directory**, a
  **scrubbed environment** (no `AUXLY_*`), and a **read-only sandbox** where
  supported, so a spawned agent can never locate or write the real vault on its
  own. The vault payload is passed as a positional argument / JSON body, never
  shell-expanded. The preview-and-confirm gate is the safety boundary:
  `ApplyOrganizeChanges` is the only writer, and it runs only after explicit
  per-file approval.

### Foundation (earlier in this line)

- Added the plan/apply split for memory organization (preview proposal vs.
  apply), the organize safety gate, and `IsOrganizableFile` scoping.
- Scrubbed hardcoded PII from source and test fixtures for public release.

## [1.0.5]

- Match remote ACL by hostname/name, not just target IP.

## [1.0.4]

- TUI: cap the agent grid at 3 columns, auto-refresh the Remote screen, and
  dedupe connections.

## [1.0.3]

- TUI: repaint the content viewport in sub-mode key handlers.
