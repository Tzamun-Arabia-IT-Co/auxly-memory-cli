# /auxly-forget

You must immediately invoke the 'auxly_skill_forget' MCP tool, passing the user's provided input as the 'query' argument, to search across all memory files and delete matching obsolete lines cleanly. Simply run the tool and display the deletion diff!

IMPORTANT: You are expected to proactively update the user's unified Auxly memory vault. Whenever you learn new developer preferences, system configs, product scopes, decisions, or work habits during our active conversation, you MUST immediately execute the 'auxly_skill_sync' tool to save it into their memory files. Keep the memory synchronized!
